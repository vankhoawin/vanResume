<h2 class="title">About Me</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am majoring in Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine.
The passion to create has always been an integral part of my life -- from playing with Lego, to making
electronic music on my computer, and now also, programming. As a computer scientist, 
we are given tools from which we can build anything imaginable; as they say, the world is your oyster.
In particular, I am interested in networked systems. It is amazing how different devices can interact
from any part of the world in a matter of seconds. Machine code is truly, the universal language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Learning computer science in my studies has not been enough. As well as
programming independently, I have been selected as a research assistant by 
Professor <a href="http://www.gillianhayes.com/" target="_blank">Gillian Hayes</a> to be a part of
the <a href="http://www.star-uci.org/" target="_blank">Social and Technological Action Research (STAR) group</a> and
<a href="http://luci.ics.uci.edu/#overview/" target="_blank">Laboratory for Ubiquitous Computing and Interaction (LUCI)</a>. For our project,
<a href="http://www.star-uci.org/tag/vsked/" target="_blank">Visual Schedule</a> (Vsked for short), I work on back-end coding
alongside other members.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As said before, I love producing and listening to music: Radiohead, Fleet Foxes,
The Tallest Man on Earth, Burial and Squarepusher are some of my favorite artists
and largest inspirations. <a href="photo.html">Photography</a> and hiking are also two interests of mine.
In many ways, programming is alike my interests; for a good end product they require experience, knowledge, and a bit
of creativity. Some computer scientists see programming as a means to an end; they certainly are high in demand, are in a
lucrative field, etc. However, for me I'd like to say that programming is an end in itself: there is something just so rewarding about
a finished program, that, like a photographer done processing his photos in the dark room, he can't wait another second to start on 
the next project. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="title">Future Goals<br>
</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I am experienced en<a id="maitai" href="images/maitai.jpg" target="_blank" >o</a>ugh,
 I would love to build a visual synthesizer as an Android app. This would be a major step in terms of programming proficiency and is an 
 intersection of code, sound and visuals.
